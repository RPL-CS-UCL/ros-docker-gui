when using the website you need to be careful becasue some parameters are not copied inside the docker-compose.yaml
and you need to add them manually 

for example the property --gpus all that activate the nvidia hardware inside the container can be ported in the 
docker-compose.yaml using

 deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
              
this command need to be positioned as the last one otherwise it could break the yaml structure
              
or --ipc=host for some reason is not included in the docker-compose.yaml even though it is a simple single parameter
in the yaml file suck as 

ipc: host
